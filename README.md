**UAV Controls** is a Python repository designed to implement various controllers and dynamics models for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based on popular research papers and methods in underactuated robot control.

## Contents
The repository contains relevant control, dynamics, and planner implementations for simulation of a quadrotor aerial vehicle. Using the same controller, the UAV can perform point stabilization, waypoint tracking, and trajectory tracking based on the planner that's used. We can also optionally use a control allocator which takes into account the thrust limits of the rotors when using a non-optimal-control-based scheme.

## Installation

This repository depends on my [hybrid ODE solver](https://github.com/micahreich/hybrid_ode_sim/tree/main) Python library which is used as the backend for the simulation and rendering pipelines. 
Setting up this repo with conda will clone and pip install `hybrid_ode_sim` automatically.

### Setup

Clone the repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/micahreich/uav_control.git  # for https
git clone git@github.com:micahreich/uav_control.git      # for ssh
```

Install pip requirements from the `requirements.txt`:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, install the `uav_control` python package locally in editable mode with:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

Now you can run any of the examples locally.

To update to a specific version of `hybrid_ode_sim` (with the virtual environment active):
```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/micahreich/hybrid_ode_sim.git@main  # to update to whatever is on the `main` branch
```
